# Takeout-Restaurant-Menu-and-Order-System

##
This is a program, built using the Python programing language, that allows customers to place orders with a takeout restaurant, and receive an itemized receipt.

## User Story
```text
AS A hungry customer with hearing and vocal impairments
I WANT to view a menu, place an order, and see my receipt
SO THAT I don't have to interact with a person until I collect my food
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```text
GIVEN A restaurant order system
WHEN I launch the program
THEN I view all of the menu items listed with their category, name, and price
WHEN I select an item from the menu by entering a number
THEN I am asked the quantity of that item I want to order
WHEN I choose the quantity
THEN I am asked if I would like to continue ordering or not
WHEN I don't choose a valid quantity
THEN I automatically receive 1 of that menu item
WHEN I continue ordering
THEN I view the menu again
WHEN I quit ordering
THEN I am shown my itemized order receipt and total price
WHEN I enter an invalid response for the menu item
THEN I am given an error message
```
